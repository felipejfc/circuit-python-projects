# CircuitPython Projects Collection

This repository is a collection of example CircuitPython projects. Each project demonstrates different functionalities and uses various components. Below is a list of the projects included in this repository along with the components used in each.

## Projects

### 1. Level Indicator
**Description:** This project uses an accelerometer to create a level indicator displayed on an OLED screen. The position of a circle on the screen changes based on the device's tilt.

**Components Used:**
- Adafruit MPU6050 Accelerometer
- Adafruit SSD1306 OLED Display
- I2C Display Bus
- CircuitPython compatible microcontroller (e.g., Adafruit Feather, Raspberry Pi Pico, etc.)
